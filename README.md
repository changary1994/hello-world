# hello-world

About Me:

My name is Gary and I am trying to familiarize myself with github so I can work on projects with my friends/team and eventually create something amazing :)

My biggest goal in life currently is to buy a house for my parents! After that, create something that will be enjoyed by millions of people around the world - whether it be a functional app that improves the livelihood of others, or a video game that will leave a lasting impression on others.

My current primary coding language is Java.
